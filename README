A simple administrator toolkit foundation to get what he wants from farm of
servers.

Assumptions:

# setup/installation
1. execute (to download buildout and fabric)
$ make
(To make buildout compatible with latest OSX I needed to patch it. Makefile
automatically patch it. Unfortunately it's not deeply tested on other
systems. So in case of buildout issues just remove patching from Makefile)
2. edit hosts file


# usage
full run:
$ ./bin/fab all summary

help:
$ ./bin/fab -l

example short run:
$ ./bin/fab ping ps vmstat summary
